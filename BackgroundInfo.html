<h3>What does space colonization mean?</h3>
<h4>Space colonization can be described as a permanent human settlement off of planet Earth. Technically humans have already begun to colonize space which can be seen in the many space stations orbiting Earth that are lived on for years at a time by many astronauts around the world. Currently, there are three functioning space stations orbiting the Earth: the International Space Station, Tiangong-1, and Tiangong-2. These space stations are used primarily today as research platforms.  </h4>
