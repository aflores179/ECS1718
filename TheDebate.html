<h3>Why are scientists considering this option?</h3>
<h4>Colonized planets would serve the same purpose as space stations initially in that they would provide insight into the possibility of having a human civilization on another planet if a catastrophe so extreme that humans would have to leave Earth were to occur. Earth is running out of resources and although humans aren not short of land, we are coming close to using all of our arable land. With a new planet comes a new start and scientists around the world are working towards giving mankind that opportunity. </h4>

<h3>Why do people think it is a bad idea to colonize planets?</h3>
<h4>Some people argue that colonizing planets is in a word, ridiculous. Putting time, resources, and Earthâ€™s best minds to the task of making another planet hospitable would be a waste because all of those things could go towards making the Earth a better place. Some also argue, even though that <i>some</i> is only a small percent of the population, colonizing another planet would be unethical</h4>
